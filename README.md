## üîß Technology Stack

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   **THREE.js:** 3D graphics rendering library.
*   **CANNON.js:** Physics engine.
*   **Simplex Noise:** For procedural terrain generation.
*   **GLTFLoader:** For loading 3D models (GLB format).

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this game locally, you need a local web server because browsers restrict loading assets (like models or ES6 modules) directly from the file system (`file:///`).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Ensure File Structure:** Make sure you have `index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js`, and the `assets/` and `animation/` directories with all necessary `.glb` and `.png` files in the correct locations.
3.  **Run a Local Web Server:**
    *   **Using Python 3:**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
        (Usually serves on port 8000)
    *   **Using Node.js (requires `http-server`):**
        ```bash
        # Install if you don't have it: npm install -g http-server
        http-server .
        ```
        (Usually serves on port 8080)
    *   **Using VS Code:** Install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".
4.  **Access the Game:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:8080`).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play

1.  **Spawn:** You will appear in a procedurally generated world.
2.  **Survive:** Your primary goal is to stay alive! Keep an eye on your **Health**, **Stamina**, **Hunger**, and **Thirst** levels in the top-left HUD.
3.  **Gather:** Explore the environment and press **E** when near resources like trees (wood), rocks (stone), berries, or alien materials to collect them.
4.  **Craft:** Press **C** to open the Crafting panel. If you have the required resources, you can craft tools (like an Axe), weapons, ammo, or a Campfire.
5.  **Manage Needs:**
    *   Eat food (like Berries or Meat) from your inventory (**I** -> Use) to replenish Hunger.
    *   Drink water (Water Bottles, Alien Water) to replenish Thirst.
    *   Rest (avoid sprinting constantly) to regain Stamina.
    *   Avoid taking damage to preserve Health. Placing and staying near a Campfire might offer some protection or warmth (check specific implementation).
6.  **Combat:**
    *   Equip weapons via the Inventory panel (**I** -> Equip).
    *   Use **Q** to attack with melee weapons or fire ranged weapons.
    *   For guns (Energy Blaster, Plasma Rifle), press **X** to aim for better accuracy.
    *   Press **R** to reload when your magazine is empty (requires reserve ammo in inventory).
    *   Defeat enemies to get loot like Meat and Gold Coins.
7.  **Explore & Progress:**
    *   Discover buildings, some may contain lootable Chests (**E** to open).
    *   Find NPCs and press **E** to interact - they might give you quests.
    *   Check your current quests by pressing **P**. Completing quests grants rewards.
    *   Collect Gold Coins and press **L** to open the Shop and buy items.
8.  **Beware the Night:** The world gets darker during the night cycle. Be prepared!
